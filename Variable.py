# Python has no command for declaring a variable.

a=5		# int
b=5.0	# float
c='5'	# string
d="5"	# string
e=True
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
a=5.0	# a is now float

# Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
e , f = 1 , 2.0

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
